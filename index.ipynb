    "__Philosophy__: This kind insterface is designed to implemen the so called _literal programming_, where the code can be mixed with rich formatted text which can even include mathematical formulas, like $E=\\gamma mc^2$. This kind of mixed text-code documents are heavily used for several purposes like\n",

    "__Design__: It consist of executable cells which are basically of two types. Both of them can be executed from the menu or the key combination: `<Shift>+<Enter>`.\n",
    "* Rich text cells like this one which works like a text editor. When executed it displays the rich text from the [Markdown sintax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Please double click this cell to enter the edit mode. Then write something (hopefully using $\\rm\\LaTeX$ of the Markdown sintax) and hit `<Shift>+<Enter>`.\n",
    "* Code cell, like the one below. There you can write code in `Python`. A new cell with the output is created after the execution. Write some mathematical operation, like `2+2`, in the next cell and hit `<Shift>+<Enter>`."
