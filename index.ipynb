The required extra packages are listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), and can be installed by using commands like\n",

This kind of mixed text-code documents are heavily used for several purposes like\n",

    "__Design__: It consist of executable cells which are basically of two types. Both of them can be executed from the menu or the key combination: `<Shift>+<Enter>`.\n",
    "* Rich text cells like this one which works like a text editor. When executed the display the rich text from the [Markdown sintax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Double click this cell to enter to the edit mode, write something (hopefully using $\\rm\\LaTeX$ of the Markdown sintax) and hit `<Shift>+<Enter>`.\n",
    "* Code cell, like the one below, where you can wite code in Python. A new cell with the output is created after the execution. Write some mathematical operation, like `2+2`, in the next cell and hit `<Shift>+<Enter>`."
